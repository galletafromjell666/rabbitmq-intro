Welcome to my repo! These notes are a personal compilation crafted during my exploration of RabbitMQ.


### Topics Covered

- Publisher/Subscribe
Learn about the classic publish/subscribe pattern, where a message is broadcasted to multiple consumers. Understand how this pattern enhances the scalability and flexibility of your messaging system.

- Work Queues
Explore the concept of work queues and discover how to distribute time-consuming tasks among multiple workers. This helps balance the workload and ensures efficient task execution.

- Direct Exchange
Dive into the direct exchange, a versatile mechanism for routing messages based on a defined routing key. Understand how to implement precise message routing in your RabbitMQ setup.

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the folders and demos in this repository. Each topic has a small demo, with most of them being similar to their previous counterparts. However, I decided not to share code between demos to clearly highlight new topics. Additionally, I've introduced comments explaining what is new.

## Getting Started
To get started, ensure that you have Docker, Node.js, and npm installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run ```npm install```.
4. Run the following Docker command to set up RabbitMQ:
```bash
docker run -d -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 -p 5671:5671 --hostname rabbitmq --name rabbitmq-container rabbitmq:3-management
```
5. Move to any topic and start both the producer and consumer using:
   - For the consumer: node consumer.js
   - For the producer: node producer.js

Happy messaging! üê∞
